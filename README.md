# Excellent Video Extractor (e.v.e.)

> #### A python script that extracts titles/links from Youtube playlists without the use of the YouTube API.


### Usage: 

Execute the python script followed by the Youtube playlist link.

 `python eve.py https://youtube_link_here.com/`
 
 If succesfully executed this will create a `playlist_name output.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
 
 This `playlist_name output.txt` file will contain all titles and links to each entry of the playlist.
